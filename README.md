# Personal Website

With each iteration of my personal website, I challenge myself to implement new frameworks, coding practices, and features to enhance my website's efficiency and complexity.

## Languages/Tools

- React
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL

## Key Features

- ðŸŒ™ **Switch between dark and light mode**: Seamlessly toggle between themes for a personalized browsing experience.
- ðŸ’» **Software and design project breakdowns**: Detailed project descriptions with embedded Figma prototypes to illustrate design processes and final outputs.

## Technical Breakdown

- **React**: Utilized React's component-based architecture, integrating libraries for responsive layouts and animations. Employed SASS for managing light and dark mode themes.
- **Backend**: Engineered a local PostgreSQL database connected with Node.js and Express.js to handle POST requests for password-protected resume access.
